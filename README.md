## Particle Simulation
Time-driven particle simulation developped hybridly with *JavaFX* and *Swing*.

### Features
Notable features include: 
- In-built electrostatic force modeling
- In-build gravitational force modeling
- Arrangement in shapes (Circle, Square, Diamond) of a variable number of particles upon a click

### Goals
The main goals of this project were to:
- Model physical phenomena computationally
- Use preexisting mathematical relationships to model phenomena, such as:
    1. Geometrical identities (*N-sided polygon*, ...)
    2. Matrix transformations (*Rotations*, *Stretching*, ...)
